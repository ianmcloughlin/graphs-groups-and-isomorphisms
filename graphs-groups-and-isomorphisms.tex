Graphs provide a way of working with and visualizing connections between objects.
They help us understand symmetry, relationships, and algorithms.

  We will use Norman Biggs' \emph{Discrete Mathematics}\autocite{biggs}, Biggs' \emph{Algebraic Graph Theory}\autocite{biggs_1974}, and Michael Sipser's \emph{Introduction to the Theory of Computation}\autocite{sipser}.

\section{Graphs} 
  A graph $G$ is a $2$-tuple $(N, E)$ where $N$ is a finite set and $E$ is a set of $2$-subsets of $N$.
  A $2$-subset is a subset with two elements.
  The elements of $N$ are called nodes or vertices.
  The elements of $E$ are called edges.

  Suppose $N = \{ a, b, c \}$ and $E = \{ \{a,b\}, \{b,c\} \}$.
  We can represent this graph using a picture, as below.
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \node[fill=atuorange, circle] (a) at (0, 0) {$a$};
      \node[fill=atuorange, circle] (b) at (0, 1.5) {$b$};
      \node[fill=atuorange, circle] (c) at (1.5, 1.5) {$c$};
      \draw[atunavy, thick] (a) -- (b);
      \draw[atunavy, thick] (c) -- (b);
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}
  Note that the graph says nothing about colours or locations of nodes.
  That is just part of the picture.
  We can draw the same graph differently if we wish.
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \node[fill=atuteal, circle] (a) at (0, 0) {$a$};
      \node[fill=atuteal, circle] (b) at (1, -1) {$b$};
      \node[fill=atuteal, circle] (c) at (2, 0) {$c$};
      \draw[atugreen, thick] (a) -- (b);
      \draw[atugreen, thick] (c) -- (b);
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}
  We have to be careful not to mistake the picture for the graph.

  One way to represent a graph is Python is to use sets.
  Unfortunately, sets in Python cannot contain other sets.
  Sets in Python are \emph{unhashable}.
  There is a similar, immutable type called \mintinline{python}{frozenset} that we can use.
  \begin{minted}{python}
N = {'a', 'b', 'c'}
# TypeError: unhashable type: 'set':
# E = {{'a', 'b'}, {'b', 'c'}}
E = {frozenset({'a', 'b'}), frozenset({'b', 'c'})}
  \end{minted}
  In any case, we usually use other, more efficient data structures to represent sets, such as adjacency matrices.
  More on those later.

\section{Subgraphs}
  A subgraph is a graph fully contained in another graph.
  We say $G' = (N', E')$ is a subgraph of $G = (N, E)$ when $N'$ is a subset of $N$ and\footnote{This last condition just ensures that $E'$ is a set of $2$-subsets of $N'$.} $E'$ only contains edges containing elements of $N'$.

  Consider the following picture of the \emph{cycle graph} $C_6$.
  It contains as subgraphs several copies of the graph above.
  Some of these copies overlap.
  One copy is depicted with teal nodes.
  Remember the colours do not matter to the graph.
  The graph does not care how it is drawn so long as the nodes and edges are correct.
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \node[fill=atuorange, circle] (0) at (0*360/6:2) {$0$};
      \node[fill=atuorange, circle] (1) at (1*360/6:2) {$1$};
      \node[fill=atuteal,   circle] (2) at (2*360/6:2) {$2$};
      \node[fill=atuteal,   circle] (3) at (3*360/6:2) {$3$};
      \node[fill=atuteal,   circle] (4) at (4*360/6:2) {$4$};
      \node[fill=atuorange, circle] (5) at (5*360/6:2) {$5$};
      \draw[atunavy,  thick] (0) -- (1);
      \draw[atunavy,  thick] (1) -- (2);
      \draw[atugreen, thick] (2) -- (3);
      \draw[atugreen, thick] (3) -- (4);
      \draw[atunavy,  thick] (4) -- (5);
      \draw[atunavy,  thick] (5) -- (0);
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}

\section{Adjacency Matrices}
  A common way to represent a graph is with an adjacency matrix.
  Two nodes $a$ and $b$ of a graph $G = (N, E)$ are \emph{adjacent} if $\{a,b\}$ is an edge of the graph --- that is, it is in $E$.
  To form an adjacency matrix for a graph, we must create an ordering of $N$.
  Remember $N$ is a set, so the elements do not come in any order.
  
  We can fix an ordering of $N$ by creating a tuple of length $|N|$\footnote{The notation $|S|$ means the number of elements in the set $S$.} where every element of $N$ appears exactly once.
  Then the tuple defines an order on $N$.
  With that order we can create the adjacency matrix of the graph with respect to it.

  The \emph{adjacency matrix} of the graph $G = (N, E)$ according to the ordering $(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_{|N|})$ of $N$ is then the matrix $A$ with entry $a_{ij}$ in row $i$ and column $j$ given by:
  
  \[ a_{ij} = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } \{n_i, n_j\} \in E \\ 0 & \text{otherwise.} \end{cases}\]

  Here $i$ and $j$ range over $1$ to $|N|$.
  
  Consider the graph below where $N = \{a, b, c\}$ and $E = \{ \{a, b\}, \{b, c\} \}$.
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \node[fill=atuorange, circle] (a) at (0, 0) {$a$};
      \node[fill=atuorange, circle] (b) at (0, 1.5) {$b$};
      \node[fill=atuorange, circle] (c) at (1.5, 1.5) {$c$};
      \draw[atunavy, thick] (a) -- (b);
      \draw[atunavy, thick] (c) -- (b);
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}
  We can fix $N$ in any order we like --- let us pick $(a,b,c)$.
  Then the adjacency matrix is as follows.
  \[ A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \]
